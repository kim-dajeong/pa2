Dajeong Kim
    - Worked on developing a link state algorithm 
    - Worked on setting up the topology

Ana Bandari
    - Worked on developing a distance vector algorithm 
    - worked on some basic file IO for the code

Collaborative Tasks
    - Flowcharted and planned algorithms together
    - Debugged and peer-programed in person together
    - Tested the code individually 

All in all we shared a fair amount of the work and both have a good understanding of how each routing algorithm works and how they differ from eachother.
